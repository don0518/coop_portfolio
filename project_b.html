                    <p class="project_intro">For this project, I worked with a companyâ€˜s website, Container Brewing.
                        Container Brewing is a fictitious company that produces high-end beers. During the project, I
                        developed the visual design, interaction cues, and responsive in the multi-platform for the
                        website. (team size: 2)

                    <h2>Stage 1 - Researching & Creating Style Guide</h2>
                    <p>Before making the webpage's style guide, my role is to research the existing beer craft company
                        and
                        their target audiences. The research helped us to develop the theme of the website and what features we
                        need
                        for it. We integrated the findings of different beer craft company and came out with our brand:
                        Container Brewing. (Above picture shows the style guide's development of the website)

                <div class="content">
                    <h2>Stage 2 - Content & Interface Design</h2>
                    <p>Once we finished the style guide, we begin to structure what we need for the webpage. As we came
                        out
                        with four different pages for the webpage, we begin to sketch different layout and implement
                        them
                        to the actual mockup by applying HTML and CSS. My role was to design the home, event, and
                        product
                        detail page. I follow visual looks from the style guide to make the interface consistent and I
                        applied the flex-box property for the later responsive process.

                    <h2>Stage 3 - Applying Responsive Page</h2>
                    <p>After we completed the structure and appearance of the webpage, my role at this stage is to
                        complete
                        the responsiveness of all pages. I applied media queries and edit flexbox properties for
                        different
                        structures in different device sizes. The reason is that we want to focus on the accessibility
                        for
                        all potential users, so they can access from different sizes of devices. We also focused on
                        user
                        experiences such as interaction cues and affordances.

                    <p>In the end, the result went good that we received positive feedback from the instructor and one
                        of
                        the highest grade in the class. During the project, I experienced many technique issues and
                        accessibility issues. However, the project pushed me to develop my problem-solving skills which
                        allow me to solve all these kinds of issues by doing researches.
