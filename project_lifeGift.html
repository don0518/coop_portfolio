                    <p>
                        The project begins with researching and understanding of existing blood donation apps, donation
                        policy, and users’ pain points. I interviewed some potential blood donors and regular blood
                        donors by collecting their data and frustrations. After I combined all kinds of raw data from
                        both my interviewee and my team’s works, I was able to create two different user journey maps
                        and personas to identify key points throughout the user’s experience with blood donation. With
                        the data presented, we are able to create an initial wireframe draft for target audiences.

                    <p>As the team finalized main features of the app, I was assigned to create digital wireframes and
                        initial workflows for Account Login/Setup. Since LifeGift aimed for a visually attracting and
                        easy access to different information, I followed with the order of hierarchy and applied
                        straight forward sentences for users to quickly understand various information and interaction
                        cues in the page.

                    <p>
                        After the team completed the first version of LifeGift, we received meaningful critique from
                        industry designers regarding workflows and visual messages. Before the team begins refining the
                        app, each of us takes the first version to ask feedback from different individuals. At this
                        point, my user testing data was collected from people who had blood donation experience in
                        Canada, people who had blood donation experience outside of Canada, and people who want to
                        donate blood but never did. The reason behind my action is to collect data from potential users
                        and target users which would help the team to minimize the scope of improvement.

                        The previous stage helped us to understand more about our users and acknowledging areas of
                        refinement on each feature. I was assigned to improve Welcome Page, Account Login/Setup,
                        Tracking User’s Accomplishment Page and create Tool Tips for first-time users to understand how
                        to use the app.

                        content to improve readability. For the Welcome Page, I created multiple infographics to
                        present an overview of LifeGift. These infographics and short descriptions allow users knowing
                        what they would expect in this app and provide a brief introduction of different features.

                        Same as the Welcome page’s initial design, I rebuilt the content’s size to improve readability.
                        In the new Profile Setup Page, I replaced the BC Services Card Number section (see initial
                        wireframe) with Inserting User’s Blood Type. The rationale is to allow users who already know
                        their blood type so the system can collect this information before the donation happens.
                        Besides, users who do not know their blood type can skip this process.

                        different visual milestones to record user’s blood donation progress. While saving the
                        progress, these milestones also give users a sense of achievement after each time of donation
                        which encourages users to donate next time.

                    <h2>Refining Tracking Who You Helped Page</h2>
                    <p>
                        Initially, we had this page as the landing page of Tracking Progress. Although the page is
                        visually attractive, the feature itself seems incomplete - more like a sub-page of a key
                        feature in this app. I took this critique as the inspiration and rebuilt this feature as one of
                        the sub-pages of Tracking User’s Accomplishment Page. I created a new workflow and layout for
                        this page which looks like a sub-feature of Tracking User’s Accomplishment Page. The first page
                        of this sub-feature shows overall donation history and the second page shows the history in
                        detail (such as the location of blood used, thank-you-message from the receiver, etc.). By
                        doing this separation of pages, the user can quickly look through the donation history without
                        confusing by large amounts of information. With helps from teammates, we also created different
                        avatars to represent different receivers that user’s blood used to help (not only for visual
                        but to protect receivers’ privacy).

                        numbers sub-features, I want to give users a quick starting guide for them to understand what
                        is in the app and how to use it. Users are also allowed to skip this starter guide if they are
                        second time user of this app.

                    <p>The result of this project went well and LifeGift was one of the successful apps in the class.
                        However, we had serious critiques from the earlier stage in which LifeGift does not meet its
                        objective, "to solve the issue of low returning rate on blood donation". Besides, the initial
                        interface design did not satisfy users to have a fun, efficient, and informative experience. I
                        found out these issues are mainly caused by the lack of early-stage researching and biasing on
                        users’ experiences. Although the team finally managed and solved issues, the experience shows
                        the importance of researching and analyzing in the early stage.
