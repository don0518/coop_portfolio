                    <h2>Project Context</h2>

                    <p class="project_intro">For this project, we worked with an existing mobile application,
                        Citymapper, and designed a new
                        feature for it. Citymapper is transit and mapping app that helps users navigate around the city
                        and
                        guide them on transportation. Citymapper can be used on multiple platforms and is available for
                        different major cities around the world. (team size: 3)

                <h2>Stage 1</h2>
                <p>
                    This project begins with researching and understanding of the existing app: Citymapper. After we
                    learned the current interface inside and out, we interviewed multiple potential and primary users
                    to do user-test and take notes on the user journey map. As a result, this way helped me to learn
                    more about the application itself and to understand users' needs.

                <h2>Stage 2</h2>

                <p>After stage 1's research, I brainstormed an AR camera navigation feature that helps pedestrians
                    navigate around cities by showing them digital street signs and virtual arrows overlaid on the
                    sidewalk to show which way to walk. However, we realized the feature is too simple to be
                    implemented into the app and it did not satisfy users' needs. Therefore, we integrate the intention
                    of AR features with other ideas into a new feature: weather feature.

                    The main aspect of the weather feature that serves the most important function is showing the user
                    alternative sheltered routes. Not only will users be able to select and plan their quickest route
                    to their destinations, but they can also find the quickest sheltered alternative to guide their
                    travels when unexpected rain or snow hits during the day. Users can select the quickest/sheltered
                    route during different weather conditions by simply pressing on buttons. We give users freedom
                    based on their selections and not affecting their experiences.

                    After deciding on pursuing a weather alert feature, the team separated to do mockups for 1) Feature
                    Onboarding 2) Selecting Sheltered Route 3) Viewing Weather Forecasting Information 4) Set
                    Notifications 5) iPhone Widgets. 6) Tool tips<br>
                    I was in charge of making mockups for Set Notifications, iPhone Widgets, and Tool tips. Since the design needs to
                    follow with the existing interface, I used Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to refine the interface
                    with a consistent look. The problem that I encountered was the iPhone Widgets needs to present a
                    strong hierarchy for users to notice the change in weather. Therefore I used strong colour contrast
                    and icons to catch users' attention.

                <h2>Self Reflection</h2>
                <p>The result of the project went good. However, according to the feedback from the professor, we did
                    not implement the weather feature fully with user freedom. By saying that, the feature does not
                    have an automatic notification feature when there are weather changes. The project developed my
                    problem-solving skills and critical thinking skill. In the future, I will be looking for more
                    usability tests and integrate these data into the project fully.
