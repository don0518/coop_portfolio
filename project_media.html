                    <h2>1. The Short Documentary Film</h2>

                    <p class="project_intro">The short documentary film, Kitchen on the Ridge follows a small
                        restaurant owner that immigrated to Vancouver, Canada in 1996, in hopes of achieving the
                        American dream. The overarching theme of the documentary is the adaptation from Chinese to
                        Western culture and how having a language barrier can become a huge obstacle to overcome.
                        During the filming, my tasks included Cameraman, Lighting, Editing, and Post-processing. The
                        project allows me to collaborate with the owner of the restaurant and I gained lots of
                        professional experience in making effective communication with clients. On the other hand, I
                        was able to improve my time management skills which manage my schedule wisely due to
                        short-period filming and editing time. (team size: 3)

                    <h2>2. Visual Effect Video</h2>

                    <p class="project_intro">"Vision" is an individual visual effect project that allows me to practice
                        the
                        workflow of Adobe AE and PR. I spent one month on building this project and its objective aims
                        to present a portfolio-quality work that represents my design philosophy. I combined visual
                        effects and typeface with raw footages that I took in the Great Vancouver and I experienced a
                        lot from managing my schedule with other school projects. Throughout the learning, I benefit a
                        lot from researching adobe tutorials to fulfill my need for technical skills. The experience
                        was a valuable practice to learn the importance of early-stage researching and workflow
                        planning.

                    <h2>3. 3D Animation</h2>

                    <p class="project_intro">"Boba" is a 3D animation created through Maya and Adobe PR. The project
                        took one month to complete and I worked as a team leader with other three team members. Since 3D
                        animation takes time on building up models, rigging character's action, and rendering
                        animation, I managed each team member's schedule and assigned different tasks based on their
                        abilities. The project is very time-consuming for a month and I handled it cautiously to avoid
                        mistakes. Although the team followed a well-planned schedule, we still faced challenges from
                        the technical side. We solved issues by researching online resources or find alternative
                        solutions to fulfill the requirement. The project helped my skill to gain valuable assets of
                        working in a team and I learned the importance of communication when I led the team. (team
